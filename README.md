# demos-linux
Demos for instruction and exploration of the Linux C/C++ API

This repo contains a lot of examples which explore the Linux user space API (and the some of the kernel API).
The idea is to use these examples to:
- resolves disputes how a certain API works
- show how to use the API in a real live example which complies
- test the performance of an API
- teach the API as part of a course
- enable to test the API in isolation from a large project in order to determine if you want to use it and if so how
