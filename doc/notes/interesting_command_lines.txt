to clear buffer and cache of the os:
	sudo sh -c "sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
	or
	sudo sysctl vm.drop_caches=1
show cache sizes as well as other parameters:
	$ lscpu
to turn your system into a router:
	sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
to change affinity of an interrupt handler:
	sudo sh -c "echo 02 > /proc/irq/17/smp_affinity"
	(make sure that you don't have "/usr/sbin/irqbalance" running as
	it may override your choice in a very short time...)
to find where a process is stuck in the kernel:
	ps -o wchan:40,comm -p [PID]
