- my README.md I mention how many examples I have (1000).
	This should not be hardcoded but rather templated.
- currently checking kernel code is disabled
	(DO_CHP:=0 in the Makefile)
	fix that.
	see that this works in ci/cd too.
- my github ci/cd does not build kernel modules (make DO_STP=0 in templates/.github/workflows/build.yml.mako).
	fix that.
- my github ci/cd does not do "check_all".
	fix that.
- try to fix the compilation problems in files which are called "*.moved"
	(which were renamed to *.moved to avoid compiling them)
- add "warnings as errors" for kernel modules.
	Look for KCFLAGS in the makefile and see that it's not used.

- do example of reading the temperature of all cpus
	or maybe just of one cpu at N seconds intevals
	from /proc.
	I need to find exactly where in /proc I can find that info.
- use templar to state EXACTLY how many demos I have in the REAMDE.md
	file and the number of lines in them
- do example of rdtsc on x64.
- fix the get rdtsc examples in low_level.h and move examples from
	us_helper.h to low_level.h
- do example that shows that performance of SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_FIFO
	is the same when all is quiet.
- wrapper_compile.py and wrapper_make.pl should be moved to templar (and the
	perl script should be rewritten in python)
- do a demo of mq_open.
- do example of backwards compatible C object oriented code.
	union - to hide data.
	size in the header to pass around variable sized object with no point.
	methods.
- web server using splice.
- do networking select example.
